My time is my most valuable resource.
Be curious! Ask your questions, and don't feel silly about learning new things!


Google my questions as best I can before asking questions to a human.
Taking fast notes during class, and spend time after making them into detailed, easy to read notes after class.

Shout out to my wonderful partner for always asking me what I learned that day so I can gush about what excited me/work through anything I'm confused with. Also shout out to my cat for all those snuggles.
